# 🐯 animal-image-classifier

A machine learning project that classifies images of 10 exotic animals using a deep learning model and deploys it through a Streamlit app.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project:
- Uses image classification to recognize different exotic animals
- Trains a CNN model (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)
- Deploys the model in an interactive Streamlit app

## 🐾 Animal Classes
The model is trained to recognize the following animals:
- lion 🦁
- tiger 🐯
- elephant 🐘
- zebra 🦓
- giraffe 🦒
- kangaroo 🦘
- panda 🐼
- monkey 🐒
- bear 🐻
- flamingo 🦩

## 🧠 Tools & Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Roboflow (for dataset management)
- Streamlit (for deployment)
- MLflow (for experiment tracking, optional)
- GitHub (for version control)
